# BasicBubbleCollision
A very basic graphical window with 2 bubbles colliding.

# Background
I wanted to learn a little bit of FreeBasic for its graphical capabilities in 2009. I wanted to experiment with graphical windows, motion, collisions and control.
It's interesting is how the bubbles collide against each other and the wall. It's possible to move the lower bar with left and right.

One thing that is a little disturbing is the flickering of the screen because it doesn't use framebuffer.
